# Antimony rules
Controls:
* arrow keys: move cursor
* tap x: select relic
* hold x: form paradox!

*Goal*
Collect 3 matching relics to form a paradox. Form 5 paradoxes to win!

*Gameplay*
This is the timeline, It is made up if relics. Each relic has a shape, solar and number

The dot represents the present moment. The right of the dot is the future
The left of the dot is the past

This is your hand. It is also made of relics. You can use relics in hand to travel back and forth through time to collect relics.

You can use relic numbers to travel forwards in time.
Here a relic from the future is obtained by:
* First selecting the relic with number 4 in hand
* Then selecting the relic in the timeline 4 spaces in the future

You can use relics with matching color or shape to travel backwards in time.
Here a relic from the past is obtained by:
* First selecting the ring relic in hand
* Then selecting the ring relic in the past (matches by shape)
* Note: in the above scenario, we could have instead obtained the yellow skull in the past (matches by color)

When you have 3 relics in hand that match by shape, color or number, hold x to form a paradox (see bottom right). Remember, 5 paradoxes win the game!

*Skipping a turn*
You may skip a turn by holding Z. Skipping a turn means replacing a relic in the timeline with one from the relic pool (see below)

*Losing the game*
This is the paradox counter. It is made up of a number (relic pool) and 3 dots (timer)
Timer: every time you obtain a relic but do not form a paradox, the dots decrease by 1. When there are no dots left, you have to replace a relic in the timeline from the relic pool
Relic pool: shows number of relics left in relic pool. You draw from relic pool when:
* the turn counter (described above) runs out; or
* you form a paradox
 When this reaches zero you lose the game!

*One more thing:*
This is the relic codex: every time you form a paradox, it selects a new color. The selected color means all relics of that colour cannot be used to form a paradox!


*Error messages*
* error: relic is not 4 spaces in future
* error: relic in past does not match by color or shape
* error (when counter-reaches-zero swapping): relic must match by shape, color or number

*Instructions*
* Your adventure begins. Good luck, time mage!
* Paradox formed:
	* paradox formed - well done! tap x for next steps
	* choose relic to replace with relic from pool 
	* choose relics in timeline to swap with hand
* paradox not formed and round counter zero:
	* round counter has run out. Tap x for next steps
	* choose relic to replace with relic form pool
		* relic must match by shape, color or number
	* …skipping turn…
